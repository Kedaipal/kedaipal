# Kedaipal — WhatsApp-First Order Hub

See full project context: [`./PROJECT_CONTEXT.md`](./PROJECT_CONTEXT.md)

## Quick Summary
**Kedaipal** ("kedai" + "pal") — B2B SaaS order hub for serious WhatsApp sellers in Malaysia. WhatsApp is the wedge; long-term vision is omnichannel (Shopee, Lazada, TikTok Shop, StoreHub).

**Target cohort (current):** Established **F&B home sellers** doing 20+ orders/week — cake decorators, frozen food sellers (with reseller networks), kuih and pastry sellers. The outdoor-gear vertical was the original beachhead but real-world adoption shifted to F&B; positioning is now anchored on universal F&B pain.

**Universal pain × universal TAM:**
1. *"I'm missing orders buried in WhatsApp chat history."*
2. *"I'm chasing customers for payment confirmation."*

- Storefront: `kedaipal.com/<retailer-slug>` (no shopper auth)
- Dashboard: Clerk-protected
- Catalog: hosted in Convex (NOT Meta Commerce Catalog)
- Flow: WhatsApp → CTA URL button → web storefront → cart → `wa.me` deep link with `ORD-XXXX` → Convex confirms

## How we decide — "what would a CTO do?"
The product owner is the **CTO / sole dev**; decisions we make together should pass a CTO's bar, not just "does it work." When designing or reviewing any change:
- **Think end-to-end about the human in the flow.** A feature isn't done when the happy path works — it's done when the seller and the buyer are *eased through* it: clear copy, sensible defaults, no dead ends, no states that silently confuse. When a backend change opens a new state, ask "what does each side now see, and is it obvious what to do next?" and patch the UI/UX, emails, and bot replies to match.
- **Polish proportional to impact** — not every feature needs to be gold-plated, but every feature should at least cover the obvious UX easements (a disabled-with-reason button beats a wrong-but-enabled one; a one-line "here's what happens next" beats silence).
- **Decisions are decisions.** A call made here is a decision to build on, production-grade and for the long run — not a demo or a stopgap awaiting sign-off. Surface trade-offs and flag follow-ups proactively (think ahead), but don't stall.
- **Always ship code + tests + docs together** as the baseline (see existing memory). Tests prove the easement holds; docs keep the next person oriented.
- **No lazy / convenient placement — own the structure.** Never park a feature wherever code already happens to exist, append a new option to the end of a list, or reuse the nearest tab/section just because it's less work. Decide *where* something belongs (information architecture, tab/section, list position, naming) by **meaning and urgency**, and proactively restructure when the right home doesn't exist yet (e.g. a new settings tab). The CTO should not have to point out that an order-flow setting doesn't belong under "WhatsApp", or that an urgent filter shouldn't sit last — get it right the first time and state the reasoning. When you touch adjacent lazy patterns (hardcoded duplicates, stale copy), fix them in passing rather than matching them.

## WhatsApp Model — Shared WABA (permanent)
Kedaipal owns **one Meta-verified WhatsApp Business Account** that handles outbound messaging for every retailer. Retailers do NOT need their own WABA, business verification, or SSM registration. Retailer brand surfaces via `{store_name}` in message content; sender number is Kedaipal's.

**Implication:** "No Meta verification needed — live in 5 minutes" is the structural moat vs. WATI / SleekFlow / EasyStore / Orderla. WABA quality is a shared resource — protections live in [`Sprint 4 WABA Protection task`](https://app.clickup.com/t/86expmgep).

Pricing, business model, and founder/entity details: see [`PROJECT_CONTEXT.md`](./PROJECT_CONTEXT.md#business-model).

## Tech Stack
- **Messaging:** WhatsApp Cloud API direct (no BSP). Production WABA verified Apr 2026.
- **Backend/DB:** Convex (functions, HTTP actions for webhooks, scheduled jobs)
- **Frontend:** TanStack Start (React + Router/Query) + Tailwind, **mobile-first hard requirement**
- **Auth:** Clerk (retailer dashboard only)
- **Hosting:** Cloudflare Workers/Pages + Convex Cloud
- **Payments (planned):**
  - **Subscription billing (retailers → Kedaipal):** Stripe + HitPay/Billplz (FPX + e-wallets)
  - **Customer payments (shoppers → retailers):** HitPay Connect / Billplz / Stripe Connect — retailer-owned gateway accounts, Kedaipal never touches order money

## MVP Status (shipped Apr 2026)
1. Hosted storefront at `/<slug>` — browse, cart ✅
2. WhatsApp bot CTA URL button entry ✅
3. Cart → `wa.me` handoff with order ID ✅
4. Convex parses order, confirms in chat ✅
5. Automated status updates (confirmed/packed/shipped/delivered) ✅
6. Retailer dashboard (products, inventory, orders, settings — live via Convex) ✅
7. Customer tracking page with "I've paid" flow + manual payment claim ✅

## Recently Shipped (post-MVP)
- **Customer Database (CRM-lite)** ✅ — `customers` entity keyed by `(retailerId, waPhone)` with denormalized lifetime aggregates, auto-captured WhatsApp pushname, private notes, and a `/app/customers` dashboard (list + detail). Backend + UI. The S1 "Customer DB" roadmap item. See [`docs/customer-database.md`](./docs/customer-database.md). Blocks Automated Reminders + Broadcast.
- **Webhook signature verification** ✅ — inbound `POST /webhook/whatsapp` verifies Meta's `X-Hub-Signature-256`. See [`docs/whatsapp-webhook-security.md`](./docs/whatsapp-webhook-security.md).
- **Channel adapter seam** ✅ (Phases 1–3) — WhatsApp is now one of N messaging channels behind a uniform `ChannelAdapter` (`convex/lib/channels/`). Outbound/inbound/signature all flow through `getAdapter("whatsapp")`; the order orchestration is channel-neutral. Pure refactor, zero behavior change (one delta: signed-but-malformed webhook body → `200`+log, not `400`). Identity migration (`waPhone` → `channelUserId`, Phases 4–6) deferred until a 2nd channel is greenlit. See [`docs/messaging-channels.md`](./docs/messaging-channels.md).
- **Mockup / proof approval** ✅ — made-to-order custom products gate production on buyer sign-off. Per-product `requiresProof` toggle → orders get a third independent dimension `mockupStatus` (`pending → submitted → approved`, + `changes_requested` loop) that blocks `confirmed→packed` until the buyer **approves on the tracking page** or the seller **waives** after a 48h grace. Seller uploads + WhatsApp-sends the mockup; buyer approves/requests-changes; seller emailed on each. Code uses **`mockup`** (not `proof` — that's the payment screenshot). Reminder nudges deferred (waiver is time-based). See [`docs/proof-approval.md`](./docs/proof-approval.md).
- **Product Variants** ✅ — products generalized from flat single-SKU to **option-axes + variant-rows** (Shopify/Shopee/TikTok shape). New `productVariants` table holds per-variant price/stock/SKU/weight/image; `products` keeps **0–2 option axes** + a `blockWhenOutOfStock` (made-to-order) toggle. Every product resolves to ≥1 variant (implicit `optionValues:[]`) — no separate simple-product path. Storefront pill pickers + two-reason grey-out + markdown descriptions; dashboard variant-grid editor (axis presets, bulk-fill, per-row image/deactivate). Caps (2 axes / 50 variants) = TikTok/Shopee/Lazada parity. Schema **widened** (dev only); the production backfill→narrow migration is a separate task. See [`docs/product-variants.md`](./docs/product-variants.md). Mockup requirement is now **per-variant** (not all-items), and payment moved to **after** mockup approval for custom orders.
- **Self-collect pickup locations** ✅ — multi-location pickup with dashboard setup; frugal scope (free-text address + Waze/Google Maps deep links, no Places API). Map URLs patched for Waze mobile/desktop + place details. ClickUp `86exq8ymf`. See [`docs/fulfilment.md`](./docs/fulfilment.md).
- **Optional delivery (symmetric fulfilment)** ✅ — delivery is now a first-class toggle (`retailers.offerDelivery`) like self-collect, so sellers offer delivery-only, pickup-only, or both. A **working-method invariant** (enforced in `retailers.updateSettings` + `pickupLocations.setActive`, mirrored in the UI + storefront) guarantees a storefront never loses its last way to receive an order — "working" self-collect requires ≥1 active pickup location. Legacy default asymmetry: `offerDelivery` undefined → **true** (vs `offerSelfCollect` → false), no migration. Settings "Pickup" tab → **"Fulfilment"** (two toggle cards), checklist step → "Set up delivery & pickup" (shown to all). ClickUp `86exu4grm`. See [`docs/fulfilment.md`](./docs/fulfilment.md).
- **Order note at checkout** ✅ — shopper attaches one free-text instruction to an order. See [`docs/order-note.md`](./docs/order-note.md).
- **One-tap copy payment details** ✅ — shoppers copy acc no / DuitNow ID from the order details page. ClickUp `86exv7772`.
- **Store description on storefront** ✅ — retailers set a short public blurb (`retailers.storeDescription`, ≤280 chars) that renders under the store name on `/<slug>`, replaces the generic tagline when set, and feeds the SEO/OG description. Plain-text, escaped, line-clamped. ClickUp `86extzdmd`. See [`docs/store-description.md`](./docs/store-description.md).
- **Payment handshake** ✅ in production — the manual two-button payment confirmation flow; canonical doc is [`docs/payment-handshake.md`](./docs/payment-handshake.md) (roadmap doc superseded).
- **Landing + pricing + cost redesign** ✅ (merged Jun 11, PRs #24/#25) — animated mobile-first UI, branded OG image + fresh structured data (SEO), dark-background logo variant, Kris's FROZEN-led assets live. **Founding-spot CTAs open WhatsApp contact, not sign-up.** Setup Wizard + Legal Pack (AUP/Terms/Privacy) + ROI weekly digest also complete in ClickUp.

## Active Roadmap (17 tasks, 6 sprints, May 25 → Aug 16, 2026)
Tracked in [ClickUp Product Roadmap](https://app.clickup.com/90182681518/v/li/901818308046). High-level:
- **S1–S3 (revenue plumbing):** Customer DB, Order Inbox, Date Picker, Subscription Billing, Legal Pack, Landing+Pricing Rewrite, Setup Wizard, White-Glove Scheduler, PostHog → **first paid customer by Jul 5**
- **S4 (WhatsApp depth):** WABA Protection, Automated Reminders Cron, PWA + Push
- **S5 (growth surface):** Customer Payment Gateway, "Graduate from Orderla" landing + CSV import
- **S6 (acquisition on):** Broadcast, Targeted Ads (validation-first budget)

**Status (12 Jun 2026):** Of S1–S3, done = Customer DB, Legal Pack, Landing+Pricing rewrite, Setup Wizard. **Subscription billing v1 slipped to ~Jun 30** — 7 subtasks under `86expn2qg`, all to-do, Zaki. Still open: Order Inbox (`86expm4xx`), Date Picker (`86expm524`). In progress: Multiple payment methods (banks + QR, `86extzdpk`); in review: bulk product import rework for variants (`86exu482j`).

## Architectural Constraints
- Schema must treat WhatsApp as one `channel` — leave room for marketplace connectors post-MVP
- **Messaging goes through the `ChannelAdapter` seam** (`convex/lib/channels/`): orchestration emits normalized `OutboundMessage`/`InboundEnvelope` via `getAdapter(channel)`; provider-specific wire logic (Meta payloads, signature scheme) lives inside the adapter. Add a channel = new adapter + registry entry + webhook route, no order-flow changes. See [`docs/messaging-channels.md`](./docs/messaging-channels.md).
- Mobile-first: ≥44px tap targets, single-column, sticky CTAs, bottom-anchored actions
- Multi-tenant via slugs from day one
- **All outbound messages flow through `wabaProtection.canSend()` gateway** once Sprint 4 ships — enforces rate limits + opt-outs + Meta quality status (sits inside the adapter's `send`)
- **Inbound `POST /webhook/whatsapp` verifies Meta's `X-Hub-Signature-256`** (HMAC-SHA256 with `WHATSAPP_APP_SECRET`) and **fails closed** — set the env var before deploying or webhooks 500
- **Customers are keyed by `(retailerId, waPhone)`; aggregates are denormalized** (refreshed on order create/cancel via `linkOrderToCustomer`/`decrementAggregatesForCancel`, counted once per order). Display name resolves `name → waProfileName → phone` via `getDisplayName`, mirrored in `convex/lib/customer.ts` + `src/lib/customer.ts`. A retailer-edited `name` is never overwritten by an inbound pushname.
- Customer payment gateway is **retailer-owned** (HitPay Connect / Billplz / Stripe Connect) — Kedaipal is never the merchant of record for shopper transactions

Competitive positioning vs Orderla: see [`PROJECT_CONTEXT.md`](./PROJECT_CONTEXT.md#competitive-landscape).

## Out of Scope (current sprint horizon)
- Meta Commerce Catalog integration
- BYO WhatsApp Business Account (per-retailer WABA) — deliberately ruled out, see shared-WABA section
- Free tier (deferred until 50 paying customers)
- Marketplace connectors (Shopee, Lazada, TikTok Shop) — original roadmap, parked until F&B core is stable
- Native mobile apps — PWA gets ~80% of the value
- Lawyer-drafted legal docs — using Iubenda/Termly templates + self-drafted AUP for v1
